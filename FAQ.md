## Why the name `react-only`?

This library was initially named like because its initial purpose was to render certain components **only** on specific screen sizes. I wanted to use the name `react-responsive` or something like this but it was already taken ðŸ¤·.

## Why isnâ€™t there an option to retrieve the current breakpoint?

This is a bit hard to do and also it doesnâ€™t really match this libâ€™s philosophy because breakpoints overlap each other.\
Letâ€™s say that the breakpoint related to the current viewport is `md`, `smUp`, `xsUp`, `mdUp`, `md`, `mdDown`, `lgDown` and `xlDown` will all match this viewport.

We could say â€œOkay but if we donâ€™t consider the `Up`s and `Down`s, we could have a 1-1 binding. But this couldnâ€™t work either with custom breakpoints. Anyone could have a `phone` breakpoint that goes from 200px to 700px, a `tablet` breakpoint that goes from 500px to 1100px etc. And in this case, a viewport of 600px doesnâ€™t match a unique breakpoint.

Thatâ€™s why the hook `useOnly` was created.

## Why does `useOnly` returns `undefined` during the initialization?

Until the version `2.1`, `useOnly` was initialized with `false`. But if the actual initial value is `true`, the component using `useOnly` could blink during the initialization.

Also from a strictly logic point of view, you could expect `useOnly('mdUp')` to be the opposite of `useOnly('smDown')`. But during this initialization, if you had those 2 defined in the component, their initial value would be both `false`. Which makes impossible to which one is right.

With the initial value being `undefined`, it is possible to do `if (value === undefined) return null;` in the component so that this state is avoided.
